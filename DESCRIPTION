Description: Designed for prediction error estimation
        through resampling techniques, possibly accelerated by parallel
        execution on a compute cluster. Newly developed model fitting
        routines can be easily incorporated. Methods used in the package are detailed in
        Porzelius Ch., Binder H. and Schumacher M. (2009) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btp062>
        and were used, for instance, in
        Porzelius Ch., Schumacher M. and Binder H. (2011) <doi:10.1007/s00180-011-0236-6>.
